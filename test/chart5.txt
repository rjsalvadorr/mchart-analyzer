Regular Chords can be played during the verse instead of this progression above:


Verse 1:

A                  C         G             D
It's hidden far away, though someday I may tell

A                  E               Em              D
The tale of mental tangle when into your world I fell

A                C                  G            D
Without you now I wander, soaking, secretly afraid

A                      E                      Em                     D
But in your grasp the fears don't last, though some of them have stayed


CHORUS 1 ( played with standard chords ):

A          D               E          D
I wheeled around because I didn't hear what you had said

A          D              E          D
And saw you dancing with Elihu, up on Leemor's bed

A           D            E           D
And I was foggy, rather groggy, you helped me to my car

A         D        E              D
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar


Plays Main riff once: A C G D - A E Em D


Verse 2:


            A                 C                  G                     D
And on the market stands unfolding, with all the willies and their wares

A              E                     Em                     D
I shuffle by alert but numb to all the glances and the glares

A             C                 G                     D
I think of you unheeding all the times I raised my cup

A                   E               Em                   D
It's now I know that you knew that I'd soon end up end up


CHORUS 2:

A          D               E              D
I wheeled around because I didn't hear what you had said

A          D              E          D
And saw you dancing with Elihu, up on Leemor's bed

A           D            E           D
And I was foggy, rather groggy, you helped me to my car

A         D        E              D
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar


Straight into Bridge:

C                      D             A           G
You tricked me like the others, and now I don't belong

C                      D                   E
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong


Repeat Chorus:

A          D               E              D
I wheeled around because I didn't hear what you had said

A          D              E          D
And saw you dancing with Elihu, up on Leemor's bed

A           D            E           D
And I was foggy, rather groggy, you helped me to my car

A         D        E              D
The binding belt enclosing me, a sample in a jar
