Am7            G#        F
Don't blow me off so I can't help it
Am7            G#        F
When you show off I can't help it

And I know you know it's wrong but I'm ready

I know there's something about me

That you can't wait to just tell me

And I love the way you move, it's so bashful

And I know you're willing and able
Cm7                    B      Bbm11
And I know you've got someone but I'm ready
Gm7                    Fm7            Cm7
So just rid yourself of him and come get it


[Chorus]

 I see it in your eyes every time


[Bridge]
Abm7         Bbm7
I'll let you into my life
Abm7              Bbm7
And I'll show you, oh, when it's right
Abm7         Bbm7
Then I guess we can say we tried
Abm7            Bbm7
Don't let this fall by the side
Fm7      Gm7          Abm7
'Cause I can't, can't leave
Bbm7               Fm7
And I can't, can't wait
        Gm7           Abm7
'Cause I can't, can't leave
       Bbm7         Fm7
And I can't, can't wait
         Gm7            Abm7
'Cause I see it in your eyes
        Bbm7        Fm7
And I feel it every time
 Gm7                     Abm7
'Cause I see it in your eyes
