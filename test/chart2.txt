[Intro]

G

[Verse 1]

     C                 G                       D
   Happy Happy oh my friend, blow out candles once again
                      Em           Em  D   C
   Leave the presents all inside, take my hand
             G                               D*
   And lets take a ride backwards down the number line
                             Em
   You were eight and I was nine,
                              D*     (A string 0-2-3) C
   Do you know what happened then?
    C
   Do you know why were still friends?
                             G
   Laughing all these many years
                                  D
   We pushed through hardships, tasted tears
                   Em            Em D C
   Made a promise, one to keep.
                         G
   I can still recite it in my sleep
                  D*
   everytime a birthday comes
                                Em                 C
   call your friend and sing a song or whisper it into his ears or
                                    G
   write it down, just don't miss a year

[Chorus]

    G    F              C                                   G
   You decide what it contains, how long it goes but this remains,
             F           C                         G
   the only rule is it begins, happy happy oh my friend (x4)

[Solo]

Em C (x2) (during first solo)

[Bridge]

   Bm                         C
   And when I see you coming down the line with eyes wide open
     Bm                            C
   somewhere between the past and future where you drift in time
                                 D       G
   and you can see a different point of view

[Solo]

G F C
(during second solo)

[Chorus]

(NOTE: the D* has a little hammer/pull off)
