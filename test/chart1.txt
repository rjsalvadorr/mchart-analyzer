BEN (Michael Jackson)

Hi there, I believe this is the version closest to the original. The song is in 4/4 time
and in the classical guitar I fingerpick pattern i use is: i m a m a m i m
or                                                         p

i m i m a m i m . Practice with the barre chords. It sounds great!

[Verse 1]
F                       C7
Ben, the two of us need look no more
F                          C7
We both found what we were looking for
F                        A7
With a friend to call my own
     F#dim7
I'll never be alone
    D7                 G7
And you my friend will see
       C7              F
You've got a friend in me
        Bb    C         F    Bb   C
(You've got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
F                          C7
Ben, you're always running here and there
F                          C7
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
F                A7
If you ever look behind
    F#dim7
And don't like what you find
        D7                   G7
There's something you should know
       C7             F
You've got a place to go
        Bb    C        F    Bb  C
(You've got a place to go)

[Bridge]
Gm            C7
I used to say
  F            C7
 "I" and "me"
Gm             C7
Now it's "us",
F
now it's "we"
Gm            C7
I used to say
  F          C7
 "I" and "me"
Gm           C7
Now it's "us",
F             Bb  C
now it's "we"

[Verse 3]
F                            C7
Ben, most people would turn you away
F                   C7
I don't listen to a word they say
F                       A7
They don't see you as I do
                  F#dim7
I wish they would try to
    D7                G7
I'm sure they'd think again
        C7                F   Bb  C
If they had a friend like Ben
   F       Bb C
(A friend)
     F   Bb  C
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
     F
Like Ben
