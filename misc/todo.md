# TO-DO

Might be easier to have a TO-DO list in source control that gets updated along with the code. The issue tracker in GitHub can be used for larger issues, based on functionality.
You can probably get away with restricting your changes to certain blocks, if you're worried about conflicts (unlikely to happen, but whatevs).

## Chores

- Clean up the old test cases? These should probably use the `unittest` module.
- Add in more documentation strings to your classes?

## DIY Keyfinder

- [x] Update entities with new key data structure.
- [ ] Update database tables to match updated entities.
- [ ] Update usage of updated entities.
